This project showcases a comprehensive Excel dashboard built to analyze sales performance for a pizza company. Using SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and calculated fields, I structured a relational database to support deep analysis across multiple dimensions.

Key features include:
- Hourly order trends and volume breakdowns
- Best and worst-selling pizzas by category
- Six pivot tables driving dynamic visualizations
- Custom KPIs and polished formatting for clarity and usability

The final dashboard delivers a complete, intuitive view of sales operationsâ€”empowering business owners to identify peak hours, optimize inventory, and refine product strategy based on real-time insights.
