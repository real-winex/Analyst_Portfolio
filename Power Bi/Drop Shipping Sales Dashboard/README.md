This project highlights a dynamic Power BI dashboard built to deliver a comprehensive view of sales performance for a dropshipping business. Leveraging SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and calculated fields, I designed a streamlined pipeline from raw data to actionable insights.

Key features include:
- Year and month filters for time-based analysis
- Sales breakdowns by top customers and best-selling products
- Custom KPIs to track revenue, volume, and profitability
  
I architected the database structure, established table relationships, and created measures to power interactive visualizations. The result is a polished, user-friendly dashboard that enables business owners to monitor trends, identify growth opportunities, and make informed decisions with confidence
