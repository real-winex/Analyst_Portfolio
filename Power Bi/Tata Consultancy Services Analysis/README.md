This project features a Power BI dashboard built to visualize key stock performance metrics for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Starting with Excel for data cleaning and preliminary analysis, I structured the dataset and transitioned it into Power BI for advanced modeling and visualization.

Key highlights include:
- Stock trend analysis across time
- KPI integration for quick performance insights
- Interactive visuals with polished formatting
- Custom measures and table relationships for accurate reporting
  
The final dashboard offers a clear, interactive view of TCS’s market performance—enabling users to explore trends, monitor key indicators, and make informed investment assessments.
