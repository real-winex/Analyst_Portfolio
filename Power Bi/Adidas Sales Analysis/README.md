This project showcases a dynamic Power BI dashboard built to analyze Adidas sales data across key performance metricsâ€”including total sales, units sold, average price per unit, and operating profit.
I began by cleaning and preparing the raw dataset in Excel, performing initial analysis and structuring the data for seamless integration. In Power BI, I established data relationships, created custom measures, and designed interactive visualizations with polished formatting and KPI indicators.
The final dashboard delivers a clear, intuitive view of sales performance, enabling stakeholders to explore trends, compare metrics, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.
