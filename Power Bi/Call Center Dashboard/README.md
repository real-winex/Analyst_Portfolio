This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to evaluate call center efficiency across multiple dimensionsâ€”including total call volume, duration (in minutes and hours), response times, and call distribution by state and day.

Starting with Excel for initial data assessment and cleaning, I structured the dataset for seamless integration into Power BI. There, I built table relationships, defined custom measures, and crafted insightful visualizations with interactive filters for date, city, and communication channel.

The final dashboard delivers a polished, KPI-driven interface that empowers users to explore performance trends, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions to optimize call center operations.
